              The future of decentralized applications is DAOs. The dxDAO is a second-generation DAO, designed to
              facilitate
              global, open trade. It will develop, deploy, and govern decentralized trading protocols and platforms.
            </p>

            <a>
              The first dApp deployed by the dxDAO will be the DutchX, an open trading protocol for ERC20 tokens using
              the
              Dutch auction mechanism. It determines a fair value for tokens, permits trading in low liquidity
              environments
              with no third party risk, and mitigates harmful trading practices like front-running. You can find all
              information and documentation about the DutchX <a href="https://dutchx.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">here</a>,
              and join the discussion in this <a href="https://daotalk.org/" target="_blank">Forum</a>.

              <p>
                For a decentralized protocol to reach its full potential, every layer of the stack must be
                decentralized,
                including governance. When a protocol is sufficiently decentralized at each layer, it becomes more
                resilient and ultimately more trustworthy for its users.
              </p>

              <p>
                Without a central governing body, protocols and dApps will be able to more easily sustain themselves
                and
                adjust when facing adversarial risks. When the direction and parameterization of the protocol is
                collectively governed, users become more confident that further versions will align with their
                interests
              </p>.

              <p>
                In the future, software—through the collective help of human actors—will own itself, run itself, and
                strategize for itself. Unlimited value exchange is one of the most critical and vulnerable components
                of
                the decentralization stack and where this future begins.

              <a>
                The dxDAO can decide on any governance questions relating to the dxDAO or the DutchX trading protocol.
                Some examples include updates of the smart contract logic, whitelisting of tokens, changing the fee
                structure, incentivizing marketing efforts, asking for an additional security audit, or creating a
                liquidity provision on the DutchX trading protocol. The DAO may additionally find a need to fund its
                future <a href="https://github.com/gnosis/dx-daostack" target="_blank">open-source development</a>,
                which would require decision-making around allocating fees.

                <p>In the future, the dxDAO may then decide to deploy and govern other decentralized trading protocols.</p>

            <div class="body-text">
              dxDAO's initial Reputation distribution seeks to place some priority on participation in the dxDAO by
              individuals or projects that are interested in the governance of decentralized exchanges, while still
              making Reputation available to a larger user base.

              Voting will be carried out using <a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/#/" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>,
              the friendly DAO interface powered by DAOstack. By default,
              proposals submitted to the DAO require an absolute majority of voting power to pass—that is, greater than
              50% of the total Reputation in the DAO. However, this can be changed so that only a relative majority is
              required, meaning more Reputation votes for the proposal than against it within a given time frame.
              Whether an absolute or relative majority is required depends on the activity in a prediction market, in
              which proposals may be "<a href="https://medium.com/daostack/on-the-utility-of-the-gen-token-eb4f341d770e"
                target="_blank">boosted</a>" when enough tokens are staked to predict a proposal’s passing by the
              DAO. This tandem system—Reputation-based voting along with token-based predicting—is the essence of the
